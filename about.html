<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>
My name is Nick Murrin and I am a current graduate from CSUSM with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. My specialty is in Web Development.
Recently, I have been working on the idea of mindfulness, which I think is a good concept, since it focuses on being in the moment and appreciating the true value of life.
 While we navigate through our busy lives each day, whether it may be work, school, family and relationship development, or any combination of those things, we don't stop and think about being in the moment.
 This could be caused by many of us rushing alot. There have been studies about how mindfulness is beneficial to the body, mind, and soul.
